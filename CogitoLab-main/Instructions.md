`DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`

The log is an important part of the practical evaluation.

It should contain, when applicable:

### 10.1. Development iterations

For each relevant iteration:

- date or sequence number;
- goal of the iteration;
- task/problem being addressed;
- approach chosen;
- relevant implementation decision;
- result obtained;
- problems encountered;
- changes made after evaluating the result.

### 10.2. AI interactions

For relevant AI-assisted activities:

- AI tool/model used;
- prompt or instruction provided to the AI;
- purpose of the prompt;
- relevant output or concise summary of the output;
- whether the suggestion was:
  - accepted;
  - partially accepted;
  - rejected;
- explanation of the decision;
- modifications performed by the developer.

It is not necessary to record every trivial autocomplete interaction.

The focus should be on interactions that influenced the solution.
